\section{Introduction}
Over the past eight years, home prices in the Boise metro area have increased very rapidly, outpacing even some of the largest real estate markets in the country. I was interested in seeing what factors might be influencing this rise, and decided to investigate changes in the Boise Metro Area job market to see if changes in employment types could be leading to the rise in prices. This paper will be comparing changes in Tax Assessed Values (TAV) from 2000-2018 with the changes in Employment by sector over the same time period. 

Earlier this year, the Brookings Institution published a study on employment growth across the nation, and used Boise as one of the case studies. Their analysis highlighted some of the areas where Boise's employment opportunities are growing, as well as the ones that are shrinking. I will use this data as a starting point to determine which sectors to analyze in more detail.

\section{The Data}
\paragraph{} I contacted the Ada County Assessor's Office to get the data on single family homes in Boise. They sent me all of the residential,not commertial, homes in Boise for 2000-2019. The data for 2019 was trimmed, as it was not complete. The Tax Assessed Value (TAV) was selected over market value because the data set is much more complete, and less subject to bidding fluctuations. I also broke down the houses by the MLS Areas of Boise, see Table \ref{tab: mls_areas} and Figure \ref{fig: mls_map}, to see if the effect of jobs on the TAV if the houses was different by neighborhood. \par

The housing data needed some cleaning before use. I wanted to find the percent change in value in single family homes from the previous year, I did find that there were some empty lots turned into single family homes that had to be removed, as the change in value was not truly representative.\par
I obtained the jobs data sets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This data included a break down by major job category, see Table \ref{tab: job_categories}, and I found the percent change in employment numbers from the previous year. These job categories don't directly correspond to the sectors highlighted by the Brookings report.

\section{Methods}

\paragraph{}I initially developed the model with all of the job categories listed in Table \ref{tab: job_categories}. I the checked the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of the model. The VIF is used in regression analysis to assess the collinearity between the predictors, if the result is close to 1 it is good, but if the result is greater than 10 then it shows high multicollinearity. I found that the VIF score was essentially infinite which meant that I could not use the model as it was. I was then advised to perform an Automated Stepwise Regression on the data to see which of the variables I could use. I followed the steps in the Book "Statistical Analysis and Data Display An Intermediate Course with Examples in R" By Richard M. Heiberger and Burt Holland, page 297-311. When I ran the Stepwise Regression the best predictors found can be seen in Table \ref{tab: feature_key}. I then relabeled the job categories for ease of reading in plots.

I then ran the VIF test as well as checking the residuals

\section{Comments and Conclusions}
\paragraph{}I was surprised that Management Occupations was the greatest influence on the TAV of my home in the Boise Bench. I was expecting it to be Computer and Mathematical Occupations, but the computer occupations did not make it through the stepwise regression. Further research could dig further into the details of each job category and how the salary increases of that category played into the changes in housing prices. Also the stepwise regression could be run against each MLS area individually to see if there are different occupations that make it through the stepwise regression other than the occupations listed in Table \ref{tab: feature_key}.
